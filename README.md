## üìä Key Metrics & Queries

### KPI Queries

- **Total Revenue**  
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;
```

- **Average Order Value**  
```sql
SELECT (SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order FROM pizza_sales;
```

- **Total Pizzas Sold**  
```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold FROM pizza_sales;
```

- **Average Pizzas per Order**  
```sql
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order FROM pizza_sales;
```

---

### üìà Trend Analysis Queries

- **Daily Order Trend**  
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders FROM pizza_sales GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);
```

- **Monthly Order Trend**  
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) as Month_Name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, order_date);
```

### üçï Sales Performance Queries

- **% of Sales by Pizza Category**  
```sql
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue, CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT FROM pizza_sales GROUP BY pizza_category;
```

- **% of Sales by Pizza Size**  
```sql
SELECT pizza_size, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue, CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT FROM pizza_sales GROUP BY pizza_size ORDER BY pizza_size;
```

- **Pizzas Sold by Category (Feb)**  
```sql
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(quantity) as Total_Quantity_Sold FROM pizza_sales WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2 GROUP BY pizza_category ORDER BY Total_Quantity_Sold DESC;
```

- **Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue**  
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales GROUP BY pizza_name ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```

- **Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue**  
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales GROUP BY pizza_name ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC;
```
